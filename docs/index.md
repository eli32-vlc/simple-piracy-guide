## Choosing A VPN (Torrent)

If you're going to use torrent to pirate, you need a VPN.

> Do not use a free VPN for piracy!! Using a free VPN could lead to your data being sold and exposed!

#### You don't need a VPN if you live in any of these countries

- India
- Any third-world country
- Australia (Living in Australia, I've been torrenting for over four years now and have never received a copyright letter.)
- China
- Switzerland
- Many more (Google it)

#### Here are my recommendations (not sponsored)
- PIA üêê
- ProtonVPN üêê
- Windscribe
- AirVPN üêê

## Choosing A Torrent Client (Torrent)

If you want to download a large file, torrent is the best option. If you want convenience, use a direct download. If you are using direct download you don't need a VPN.

#### Here are my recommendations
- qBittorrent üêê
- Transmission üêê
- BiglyBT
- BitComet

> Stick to open-source clients as much as possible. Please stay away from "BitTorrent" and "uTorrent" as they have a bad reputation.

## Binding Your VPN to Your Torrent Client (Torrent)


Making sure your VPN is set up correctly is super important for keeping your online activities private and secure. A VPN helps protect you from possible IP leaks, which can occur if your VPN connection unexpectedly disconnects. By connecting your VPN directly to your torrent client, you ensure that all your torrenting activity is securely routed through the VPN and nowhere else.

Since each client is unique, it's a good idea to consult Google and read the documentation specific to your client. This will give you the most accurate instructions for configuring your VPN properly with your torrent client.

## Direct Download Setup (DDL)

Downloading files directly through your browser doesn't typically require any additional software or configuration. However, I recommend using a download manager anyway. Download managers can enhance your download speed and efficiently manage your downloaded files, making the process smoother and more organized.


#### Here are my recommendations (not sponsored)

- Neat Download Manager üêê
- Motrix üêê
- Internet Download Manager (Paid) üêê
- Free Download Manager
- JDownloader 2

> If your download manager offers a browser extension, I suggest installing it for added convenience and the best user experience. This extension can streamline your downloading process and make it even easier to manage your downloads directly from your browser.

## DNS Setup (All)

Usually, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might block access to piracy websites using a technique called DNS sinkholing. If you're facing sluggish speeds, altering your DNS server can sometimes be beneficial. This is because ISP DNS servers can be smaller and slower. By shifting to a different DNS server, you might encounter enhanced speed and potentially evade any DNS-based restrictions imposed by your ISP.


#### Here are my recommendations 

- Cloudlfare DNS (1.1.1.1) üêê
- Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
- Quad9 (9.9.9.9)
- NextDNS

## Adblock Setup (All)


Piracy websites often contain explicit ads, malware ads, etc. This is how they generate revenue. For our safety, ensure you use an ad blocker like uBlock Origin.
