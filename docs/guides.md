## Download YouTube Videos/Music
To download a YouTube video, you need special software that will grab the native video from YouTube. Normally, Neat Download Manager with a browser extension will do that. Sometimes you need a download manager like 'Video DownloadHelper' which will stream the video from YouTube rather than grabbing the native source.
